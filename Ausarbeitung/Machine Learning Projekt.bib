This is a great benefit in time series forecasting, where classical linear methods can be difficult to adapt to multivariate or multiple input forecasting problems. In this tutorial, you will discover how you can […]},

  abstract = {In this paper, the LSTM model in deep learning is applied to regression analysis, and the LSTM model is used to solve the problems of nonlinearity and data interdependence in regression analysis, so as to improve the traditional regression analysis model. Through the actual modeling application experiment, on the one hand, the prediction accuracy of different model parameters is compared and analyzed, on the other hand, the effectiveness and practicability of LSTM model in multiple regression analysis and prediction are confirmed.},
